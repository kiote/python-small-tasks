Read the [contributing manual](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html).
Have to be enough, but if you are such a lazy thing as me:

1. Clone scikit-learn repo onto your local machine with `git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git`.
2. Make sure `make` runs sucessfully in scikit-learn/ directory
